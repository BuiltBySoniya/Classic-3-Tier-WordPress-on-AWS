# Classic-3-Tier-WordPress-on-AWS
Deployed WordPress on a classic three-tier AWS architecture: VPC with public/private subnets, ALB, EC2 in private subnets, RDS MySQL, and EFS for shared storage. Configured NAT for outbound updates, hardened security groups, and routed traffic through the ALB for a resilient production setup.
